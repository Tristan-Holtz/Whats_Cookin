# tastebook - Turing Mod 2 Project

A site that has users with unique pantries containing ingredients to be used in different recipes. The site allows a user to search or filter recipes and mark them as favorite recipes. It should also help you determine how much money is required for any given recipe.

## Link to the live site

Here is a link if you would like to see how the site works:
https://tristan-holtz.github.io/Whats_Cookin/src/login.html

## How it works

When prompted to login, you can either enter the name of one of the fifty users or just click let's cook which will load the default user. The page starts with all the recipes available in the recipes section. From the dashboard you can search through the recipes by ingredient or name, or you can filter recipes by type. If you select a recipe it will take you to a page with instructions and ingredients required to prepare it as well as an estimation of what it will cost to purchase the ingredients. You can view the current user's pantry to see the ingredients they have available to cook with. You can also add recipes to a user's favorite recipes with the favorite button and view a list of all favorited recipes from the nav bar.
